# Chromafish's Guide to Minecraft Servers
I have two [on-demand](#what-does-on-demand-mean) Minecraft servers ready to play on if you're a member of my discord. This guide should get you connected to either and get you started with modding, if (like me) you've never done it before.

## Bushwa
A casual Java survival server for PC players who want to mod their clients, or PC players who don't want to / can't use Bedrock Edition.

If you want proxy voice chat, this is also the server you should connect to.

### NOTE: Whitelisting
This server is for members of my Discord server only, and is managed through the #minecraft-bushwa channel. When you connect for the first time you'll be given a 5 digit code. Just type `/link THAT_CODE` into the #minecraft-bushwa channel to whitelist yourself, and you'll be free to join and play.

### Server Details
- bushwa.chromafish.com
- Minecraft Java Edition - 1.21.11
- Fabric server

### Connecting to Bushwa - Modded
This is the recommended way to connect to Bushwa, and will enable you to use the in-game proxy voice chat and easily modify your Minecraft install.

1. Download the [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
1. Download either the [Bushwa Potato Edition prism export](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WeohI3ztGO8UQbw3qZqLYSEiMjDjZU35/view?usp=drive_link) for a minimal, optimized experience, or the [Bushwa prism export](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a3PAXCB8DtrH6tEwlVC19x2D238teWf4/view?usp=drive_link) for a fully modded / pretty / controller supported experience.
1. In Prism, click + Add Instance > Import > Browse and navigate to the export you just downloaded.
1. Click "Ok"

You are now free to connect to the server. [If the server times out when you attempt to connect, wait 5 minutes and try again.](#what-does-on-demand-mean)

### Connecting to Bushwa - Vanilla
If you prefer to not run any mods or 3rd party software, you can connect to the server with just the Mojang (vanilla) launcher. The only thing you will miss out on is the ability to use the proximity voice chat feature, and to modify your experience. Eventually there may be more content you can't access, but I will continue to try and support the vanilla launcher moving forward.

1. Download the [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) if you don't already have it.
1. Open the launcher and [change your version to 'release 1.21.11'](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Change-Game-Version-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition#:~:text=Click%20Installations%20on%20the%20launcher,Play%20on%20the%20top%20menu.)
1. Launch Minecraft and navigate to "Multiplayer"
1. Click "Add Server" and set the server address to "bushwa.chromafish.com"
1. Click "Done"

You are now free to connect to the server. [If the server times out when you attempt to connect, wait 5 minutes and try again.](#what-does-on-demand-mean)

## Zounds
A casual Bedrock survival server, meant for those of us on consoles, mobile devices, or who prefer a more controlled experience.

### Server Details
- zounds.chromafish.com
- Minecraft Bedrock Edition
- Crossplay supported (Windows / Console / Mobile, etc.)
- [Cold Boot Time - 2 minutes](#what-does-cold-boot-time-mean)
- 2 CPUs, 8gb RAM

#### Serverside Add Ons
None so far

### Connecting to Zounds
1. Launch Minecraft and navigate to "Multiplayer"
1. Click "Add Server" and set the server address to "zounds.chromafish.com"
1. Click "Done"

You are now free to connect to the server. [If the server times out when you attempt to connect, wait 2 minutes and try again.](#what-does-on-demand-mean)

### If you are on XBOX or Switch
There will be no "Add Server" button for you, but there are still options. Use [this guide for xbox](https://www.geyserconnect.net/guide/xbox) or [this guide for switch](https://www.geyserconnect.net/guide/switch) to connect to GeyserConnect and you'll add the server in their interface.

Make sure you select "Bedrock / Geyser server" when you try to connect.

## FAQ
### What does "On Demand" mean?
To save on cost, I am not running these servers 24/7. If the server sits with nobody connected to it (for about 20 minutes), it shuts down automatically.

The first time you try to connect while the server is offline, you will get some kind of a "connection timed out" error. This is normal, and the server will now automatically come back online. The total time this takes is the [cold boot time](#what-does-cold-boot-time-mean).

Once a couple of minutes have passed, try again and you should be able to connect just fine!

### What does "Cold Boot Time" mean?
Because these servers are [on-demand](#what-does-on-demand-mean), they may not be running when you want to connect. This means the server is "Cold" (offline). The "cold boot time" is the time it takes for the server to come online after you attempt to connect the first time.

### What other mods can I install?
**Java Edition Only** The answer here is "Try and see." If you pick a mod that requires a serverside component, the launcher will tell you, so no real risk there.
