# Session 1 (Amal)
Angler is a small fishing outpost with not a lot going on, but the people there have made it their home. Amal, one of the residents, and a Tiefling, woke up one morning to find that a friend of hers, Cade Susa has gone missing while on a courier job south of town. Amal, along with her friend Asher, decided to leave town in search of him. They found him in the forest with two escorts, a quiet elderly man and an elderly woman with a heavy accent. Suddenly mist rolled in and they were attacked by strange creatures they haven't seen before. Skillfully Amal and her friends dispatch the attackers and escort the elderly couple back to Angler, despite Amal's suspicions that all was not what it seemed with these old folk.

And as it turns out, all was indeed not what it seemed with these old folk! As they entered the Angler's Rest, the elderly man pressed his will into Amal's mind with an otherworldly ease and commanded her to lock herself away, which she happily did for several days.

# Session 2 (Moss, Honey, Shadow Dancer)
Meanwhile, an unrelated group of adventurers headed north, their carriage driven by a skiddish gnomish woman, Birbig, and accompanied by a half-elf butthole, Phraen. We joined Honey, the goliath, and Moss and Shadow Dancer the halflings as they attempted to beat the oncoming mist into town. They failed. And their driver was taken into the forest, causing the horses to panic and the carriage to careen wildly over the dirt road. Thanks to some quick thinking by the party, they broke the glass in the cart's front-facing window. Honey placed their smallest member, Moss, into the driver's seat to gain control and ultimately stop the cart.

Once stopped Shadow Dancer robs the crap out of Phraen and nobody notices, probably because he dances with shadows.

Searching through the forest, the party faced many monsters (Phraen bravely, and immediately ran away), but none of these creatures stood a chance against the party's might, or their swagger. They rescued their driver, only to discover that Phraen stole their cart, and they would have to make the rest of their trip on foot.

# Session 3 (Moss, Honey, Amal)
As they continue on the path north into town, Shadow Dancer disappears into the mists, and the rest of the party passes by an abandoned guard post. They rifle diligently through it like a bunch of hungry raccoons. Honey even goes as far as stealing a bear rug and wearing it like a cloak. It does look rad though, and Moss finds a book of elven x human smut, which I think she kept? I don't know it wasn't clear to me.

Anyway they make their way into town and find the missing cart (the axel is badly damaged and it will need repair), outside of the Angler's rest, where they find Phraen yelling at a small half-orcish child, because of course he is. Honey prevents some child abuse, and Phraen leaves, presumably to find another child to strike (they are easier to fight than spiders, after all). They discover that the child, Simon, is running the inn. His Father and Uncle are both missing. They immediately take advantage of this fact by trading music for lodging, which Simon is happy to do, because he's 7. He also doesn't have keys to any of the rooms, because he's 7.

Moss uses a clutch Mage Hand to unlock a window and gain access to the room without a key, but instead of turndown service, they find a tiefling woman, standing, as if in a trance. After poking and shoving her for a bit, they 'accidentally' throw her head first into an end-table, snapping her out of it. Amal introduces herself to the party and tells them about all that has happened to her, and they head back out to the lobby, where an extremely tired Birbig has fallen asleep on the bench. They wake her and send her to the room, bravely assuming that beds are more comfortable than benches.

Simon gives them a receipt that's actually a drawing, because he's 7, and the party makes him cook them a meal in return, for free. It's worth every penny they spent on child labor. I think the party decided to go... somewhere... maybe the barracks? To see if they could find a guard? But on their way out the door, they find a scared fisherman being chased by a group of fog monsters. They decide to try and save him.

This fight was rough, both Amal and Moss nearly died, but thanks to the actual way that spider poison damage works I guess they just wound up paralyzed. Also something weird was going on with the little spiders, they were like... Trying to come together to form a body? Like a fucked up spider based Voltron or something? That was weird but the party didn't let that happen. Oh and partway through this fight, some arrows started flying out a darkened window from the building across from the Angler's Rest (the barracks, btw, I think you knew that. Otherwise, spoilers). Someone was helping from the shadows.

Once the battle is over (Honey fucking hacked a giant spider mama into literal ribbons on top of the towns water supply. I'm sure that's fine though), an intense looking gnome woman in leather armor runs out from the barracks and checks on the fisherman, who lays unconscious in the dirt.

Between the two people left standing (Honey, and this gnome woman), they drag the bodies of their unconscious and paralyzed friends back into the safety of the Angler's rest.

# Session 4
Shadow Dancer lost his travel companions in the fog. As he searches for them, he sees the shadow of... something up ahead. He avoids it, only to find himself at the entrance to the town. He sees his party cleaning up after a great battle.

The party meets Vela Dawes, seemingly the only present guard of this town. She's apprehensive at first, but she helps them take the injured adventurers to the Chapel for medical care. There they meet Saren, a mousey half elf, and Brynn Holfwyn, the religious leader of this town. A sickness has been sweeping through the town, and the chapel has been converted into a temporary infirmary. Brynn helps patch the party up and gives them a place to rest, and in return she tells them that someone has broken into her storeroom and stolen her supply of murkroot blossom.

She asks that the party either investigate the theft or find her a new supply so she can make a more effective medicine (she believes the sickness is an advanced form of 'sight rot,' a common disease that slowly renders the patient blind). She does mention a tomb nearby that may have murkroot growing in it, but she also says that it has been overrun by goblins.

At some point - out of earshot of her boss - Saren admits to Moss that she knows who stole the supplies, and that she hid that information from Ms. Brynn. She tells the party that Brynn's own brother, Stotter Holfwyn, was here not too long ago and took the murkroot for himself. Saren said she let him, because Stotter said the disease wasn't sight rot at all. Saren agrees, and worries about what might happen if they give the patients the wrong medicine.

Armed with this knowledge they, along with Dawes, visit Stotter's home. After some light kicking-in of the door, Stotter (an eccentric bookworm from the look of it) excitedly introduces the party to Francis, his mistweaver rescue. He's all to happy to demonstrate Francis' 'zoomies.' Upon feeding the spider his last murkroot blossom, she begins to vibrate violently, becoming so fast that she can teleport short distances.

He suggests that giving the patients murkroot would be a great way to kill them faster, and tries to convince the party to instead bring him the murkroot so he can study it, and perhaps devise another way to help the townfolk. He also lets the party leave with two books, one entitled "Rare Herbs and Their Uses" and one very old looking book without a title, just a strange sigil on the cover.

Moss also discreetly swipes a book "The Cryptozoologist's Guide to the Sword Coast," and Shadow Dancer takes a sneaky top off of some strange potion Stotter was partially done brewing.

Regardless of which Holfwyn sibling the party puts their trust in, all roads lead to the tomb. So they set off, only to find the goblins who live there being attacked by mistweavers. They tactically wait until the numbers are thinned and they jump in to clean up the mess when there are just two goblins remaining (although Shadow Dancer does get a little appetizer before the main course). After killing one Goblin, they let the other escape deeper into the cave to alert the others, and before the party could explore deeper themselves, they were ambushed by goblin reenforcements.

Honey fell in battle for the first time, but was revived by Moss (though she remained unconscious, strangely). The party cleared the second room and decided it'd be safer to pull back, lick their wounds, and regroup.
