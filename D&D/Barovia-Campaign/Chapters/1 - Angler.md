</p>

Angler is a small fishing outpost with not a lot going on, but the people there have made it their home. Amal, one of the residents, and a Tiefling, woke up one morning to find that a friend of hers, Cade Susa has gone missing while on a courier job south of town. Amal, along with her friend Asher, decided to leave town in search of him. They found him in the forest with two escorts, a quiet elderly man and an elderly woman with a heavy accent. Suddenly mist rolled in and they were attacked by strange creatures they haven't seen before. Skillfully Amal and her friends dispatch the attackers and escort the elderly couple back to Angler, despite Amal's suspicions that all was not what it seemed with these old folk.

And as it turns out, all was indeed not what it seemed with these old folk! As they entered the Angler's Rest, the elderly man pressed his will into Amal's mind with an otherworldly ease and commanded her to lock herself away, which she happily did for several days.

</p>

Meanwhile, an unrelated group of adventurers headed north, their carriage driven by a skiddish gnomish woman, Birbig, and accompanied by a half-elf butthole, Phraen. We joined Honey, the goliath, and Moss and Shadow Dancer the halflings as they attempted to beat the oncoming mist into town. They failed. And their driver was taken into the forest, causing the horses to panic and the carriage to careen wildly over the dirt road. Thanks to some quick thinking by the party, they broke the glass in the cart's front-facing window. Honey placed their smallest member, Moss, into the driver's seat to gain control and ultimately stop the cart.

Once stopped Shadow Dancer robs the crap out of Phraen and nobody notices, probably because he dances with shadows.

Searching through the forest, the party faced many monsters (Phraen bravely, and immediately ran away), but none of these creatures stood a chance against the party's might, or their swagger. They rescued their driver, only to discover that Phraen stole their cart, and they would have to make the rest of their trip on foot.

</p>

As they continue on the path north into town, Shadow Dancer disappears into the mists, and the rest of the party passes by an abandoned guard post. They rifle diligently through it like a bunch of hungry raccoons. Honey even goes as far as stealing a bear rug and wearing it like a cloak. It does look rad though, and Moss finds a book of elven x human smut, which I think she kept? I don't know it wasn't clear to me.

Anyway they make their way into town and find the missing cart (the axel is badly damaged and it will need repair), outside of the Angler's rest, where they find Phraen yelling at a small half-orcish child, because of course he is. Honey prevents some child abuse, and Phraen leaves, presumably to find another child to strike (they are easier to fight than spiders, after all). They discover that the child, Simon, is running the inn. His Father and Uncle are both missing. They immediately take advantage of this fact by trading music for lodging, which Simon is happy to do, because he's 7. He also doesn't have keys to any of the rooms, because he's 7.

Moss uses a clutch Mage Hand to unlock a window and gain access to the room without a key, but instead of turndown service, they find a tiefling woman, standing, as if in a trance. After poking and shoving her for a bit, they 'accidentally' throw her head first into an end-table, snapping her out of it. Amal introduces herself to the party and tells them about all that has happened to her, and they head back out to the lobby, where an extremely tired Birbig has fallen asleep on the bench. They wake her and send her to the room, bravely assuming that beds are more comfortable than benches.

Simon gives them a receipt that's actually a drawing, because he's 7, and the party makes him cook them a meal in return, for free. It's worth every penny they spent on child labor. I think the party decided to go... somewhere... maybe the barracks? To see if they could find a guard? But on their way out the door, they find a scared fisherman being chased by a group of fog monsters. They decide to try and save him.

This fight was rough, both Amal and Moss nearly died, but thanks to the actual way that spider poison damage works I guess they just wound up paralyzed. Also something weird was going on with the little spiders, they were like... Trying to come together to form a body? Like a fucked up spider based Voltron or something? That was weird but the party didn't let that happen. Oh and partway through this fight, some arrows started flying out a darkened window from the building across from the Angler's Rest (the barracks, btw, I think you knew that. Otherwise, spoilers). Someone was helping from the shadows.

Once the battle is over (Honey fucking hacked a giant spider mama into literal ribbons on top of the towns water supply. I'm sure that's fine though), an intense looking gnome woman in leather armor runs out from the barracks and checks on the fisherman, who lays unconscious in the dirt.

Between the two people left standing (Honey, and this gnome woman), they drag the bodies of their unconscious and paralyzed friends back into the safety of the Angler's rest.

    />
</p>

Shadow Dancer lost his travel companions in the fog. As he searches for them, he sees the shadow of... something up ahead. He avoids it, only to find himself at the entrance to the town. He sees his party cleaning up after a great battle.

The party meets Vela Dawes, seemingly the only present guard of this town. She's apprehensive at first, but she helps them take the injured adventurers to the Chapel for medical care. There they meet Saren, a mousey half elf, and Brynn Holfwyn, the religious leader of this town. A sickness has been sweeping through the town, and the chapel has been converted into a temporary infirmary. Brynn helps patch the party up and gives them a place to rest, and in return she tells them that someone has broken into her storeroom and stolen her supply of murkroot blossom.

She asks that the party either investigate the theft or find her a new supply so she can make a more effective medicine (she believes the sickness is an advanced form of 'sight rot,' a common disease that slowly renders the patient blind). She does mention a tomb nearby that may have murkroot growing in it, but she also says that it has been overrun by goblins.

At some point - out of earshot of her boss - Saren admits to Moss that she knows who stole the supplies, and that she hid that information from Ms. Brynn. She tells the party that Brynn's own brother, Stotter Holfwyn, was here not too long ago and took the murkroot for himself. Saren said she let him, because Stotter said the disease wasn't sight rot at all. Saren agrees, and worries about what might happen if they give the patients the wrong medicine.

Armed with this knowledge they, along with Dawes, visit Stotter's home. After some light kicking-in of the door, Stotter (an eccentric bookworm from the look of it) excitedly introduces the party to Francis, his mistweaver rescue. He's all to happy to demonstrate Francis' 'zoomies.' Upon feeding the spider his last murkroot blossom, she begins to vibrate violently, becoming so fast that she can teleport short distances.

He suggests that giving the patients murkroot would be a great way to kill them faster, and tries to convince the party to instead bring him the murkroot so he can study it, and perhaps devise another way to help the townfolk. He also lets the party leave with two books, one entitled "Rare Herbs and Their Uses" and one very old looking book without a title, just a strange sigil on the cover.

Moss also discreetly swipes a book "The Cryptozoologist's Guide to the Sword Coast," and Shadow Dancer takes a sneaky top off of some strange potion Stotter was partially done brewing.

Regardless of which Holfwyn sibling the party puts their trust in, all roads lead to the tomb. So they set off, only to find the goblins who live there being attacked by mistweavers. They tactically wait until the numbers are thinned and they jump in to clean up the mess when there are just two goblins remaining (although Shadow Dancer does get a little appetizer before the main course). After killing one Goblin, they let the other escape deeper into the cave to alert the others, and before the party could explore deeper themselves, they were ambushed by goblin reenforcements.

Honey fell in battle for the first time, but was revived by Moss (though she remained unconscious, strangely). The party cleared the second room and decided it'd be safer to pull back, lick their wounds, and regroup.

</p>

The party chose the path less traveled to get deeper into the cave without attracting extra attention. With Shadow Dancer providing hand holds by placing pitons and rope along the cave walls, they braved the currents of river only to find that it ended in a large chamber, and ultimately, a waterfall. After narrowly escaping going over (and losing one Vela Dawes to the current) the party joined a battle already in progress between some of the surviving goblins who called this cave their home, and some more mistweavers.

The party, ignoring the pleas of a large goblin, dispatched of both the goblins AND the mistweavers, and approached what appeared to be their final foe. A mist-shrouded human at the door to the tomb within these caves.

Upon closer inspection, Dawes, having climbed up the walls and out of the waters below, recognized Tyler, one of the missing guards. He babbles incoherently for a bit, repeating the phrase "He is coming" until eventually snapping and trying to stab Dawes. With the party's help, he's knocked unconscious and bound, and Dawes takes him back to town to get help and to question him further.

The party rests before the sealed tomb door, and as they do this, Amal begins studying some of the partially translated pages of the journal Stotter gave her. It's a spell! A strange one at that. With the help of her new friends, and an unwilling test subject (Gungar, the last goblin) Amal discovers and learns the secret of "Cure Wounds," an incredible feat for any wizard.

        width="19%"

    />
</p>

The party starts outside the sealed mausoleum door deep in the caves that used to be home to a gang of goblins. Shadow Dancer discovers that he's a mother, and the party firmly cements their relationship with their adopted ward, Gungar.

After their respective baby showers they try smearing dirt on the door. This did not work. Then they immediately think "Well maybe it requires our new child, Gungar's blood," which is a normal thing to think. They try dead goblin blood, it does nothing. Then they throw a corpse into the fire, and it vanishes. With this, Honey and Shadow Dancer both yeet themselves bodily into the brazier in front of the door, finally opening it. Thank god that worked otherwise it would have been a spectacularly painful suicide.

Inside they immediately find a sample of murkroot blossom, but are overtaken by the insatiable urge to do a bit of light graverobbing, in spite of the fact that Angler is in desperate need of these medical supplies. In no rush at all, and in no particular order, the party desecrated many tombs, one by one, and solved many puzzles, before unlocking a passage to a much more importanter and biggerer burial chamber with a single coffin in the middle.

Doing what they do best, they consider all options carefully, and decide "This tomb, too, must be defiled." Triggering the automated defenses posted at the exit of this burial chamber. They dispatch of the two armed... well they weren't armed guards. They were like the exact inverse of armed guards actually. All arms, no guard.

Anyway, upon doing that, they took a closer look at the corpse in the coffin in this room, and discovered two things. 1, this motherfucker had wings. 2. he also held a glowing key close to his heart.

They of course ripped this poor soul's literal dying posession from him. I'd say it was like taking candy from a baby, but stealing trinkets from corpses is actually much easier, because they don't bite or vomit on you.

And to add insult to injury, or perhaps to rub it in the corpse's face just how dead he was and how great it was to be alive, the party ripped several feathers from his wings just to keep. Like a serial killer's trophy. And they go to his footlocker, use his stolen key, and pilfer everything they could possibly find, which turned out to be quite a bit of magical items.

Yes the party was in fact rewarded for their irresponsible negligence through material gain, and for their criminal instincts. Instincts that drove them to defile the burial chambers of champions of presumably a great godking, no less. Perhaps this was the setup of some cosmic joke whose punchline has yet to be revealed. Perhaps there is no God. Perhaps we are all living in a simulation created by five friends telling a story to one another on the internet.

Whatever the reason, the party stands now, in the tomb of the corpses they have (sometimes literally) defaced, and in the wake of their actions. What will they do now?


# Session 7

After securing some magical items, the party searched the rest of the caverns before deciding that they've gotten what they could get. On the way back to town the party noticed the fog was much thicker and encountered several overtaken townspeople, and a couple of mistweavers, standing in a circle around a cloth covered shape, crumpled on the ground. They recognized one of the townspeople as Tyler, who hours ago was carried unconscious out of the caves by Dawes.

Failing to sneak past the threat, the party fights their way through, eliminating both spider and townsperson alike. They discovered the crumpled package on the ground was indeed an unconscious Vela Dawes, looking much worse for wear. After some light healing, she describes how she was on her way back to town when she was attacked by some of the townsfolk. They overpowered her and incapacitated her. She's upset that Tyler has been killed, but she understands. The party decides to take her with them.

They take the murkroot blossom to Stotter's. He asked for some space while he studied the murkroot (cautiously, the party gave him only a small amount of the total). Instead Amal charmed him and the party stayed in his bedroom. Moss read a book about the history of Angler, and Shadow stole an expensive looking pipe. Moss then swapped the history book with a book she noticed Stotter was reading intently. Over a long rest, Stotter was able to study and develop a tincture he believes will help the townspeople. Dawes's condition was worsening, so they tested it on her.

She immediately fainted, then woke up. Looked a little better before barfing shadow worms all over the ground.

The party received 3 tinctures in total, and used one on Dawes. Stotter says he can create more, but will need more samples of blossom to do so. Once provided with some, he can produce more tincture. Claims it takes him about 30 minutes to whip up a batch.

</p>

The party hangs out with Stotter for a few more minutes, if only to "convince" him (violently) to give up the recipe for the tincture and to brew 18 more dosages. Moss realizes she stole back "A Fae Affair"

The party, along with Dawes and Gungar, decide to check on Simon on the way to deliver the cure to the chapel. They arrive at the Angler's Rest to find the front door standing open and the building empty for the most part. The dense mist from outside is strong in here. There are a couple of mistweavers shrouded in dense fog lurking in the tavern. The party makes quick work of them and go deeper into the building to investigate a banging sound.

Simon has been locked in his room. The party frees him, investigates the kitchen and dining room, and then forces their way into the pantry, where they locate some food, and a trap door in the floor. They open it. Shadow Dancer jumps heartily into the cellar where two more mistweavers lay in wait. Clearly the situation in the Angler's Rest has changed since the party left two days ago.

Shadow is paralyzed by spider venom, and his friends work together to defeat the monsters here. Pushing into the next room they find two overtaken townsmen and a large orcish man beaten and tied to a chair. Honey attempts to force-feed both overtaken men doses of the cure. The older of the two falls unconscious and starts to hurl shadow worms, but the younger man, strangely, wholly dissolves into mist.

The orc reveals himself to be Resha, Simon's father and the proprietor of the inn and tavern. The party take him and the unconscious Merrin (the older overtaken man) up to the main floor, where Resha, Simon, Dawes and the rest of the party take refuge in two of the inn rooms, after realizing that Birbig, their gnomish driver from before, is also not in a great way.

Over a long rest the party hears someone(s?) break into the inn and move deeper into the building before their footsteps become inaudible.
